Amongst the millions of galaxies maybe you and I were meant to be.
I don't write very often but you make me want to write thousands of poems just to describe what you do to me.
You make me the happiest in this moment, the ocean between us can't stop that.
When reality calls me back, I know you will hold me in your arms.
You are the moon to the sea, always pulling me towards you.
The universe wanted us to meet like this, conspiring for us again and again
I'd cross the ocean just to take your hand.
